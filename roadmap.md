# Problem
People in general find recycling/reuse hard. This results in recyclable material ending up in the wrong category or as combustible/landfill.

# Solution
This project aims at creating an extensible platform for providing information to customers regarding recycling, reuse and environmental impact of products. The idea is to create an open source core that is maintained by the team. It should be possible to extend if a business case can be made or that there are some kind of special requirements (like country specifics). The first step is a simple community driven app where the users can lookup and vote on how the products should be recycled. This app is the outcome of the hackaton.

# Benefactors
* End customers - less confusion/frustration
* Recycling companies - less sorting/faulty process input
* Municipality - less landfill
* Environment - increased reuse/recycling

# Possible business cases
* Promotion of alternative products that is better for the environment
* Interaction with reuse marketplaces (like Blocket, Tradera and Facebook) in order to promote buying/selling second hand instead of new

# Marketing
* Recycling companies can promote the app in the recycling rooms
* Word of mouth should be feasible as it is community driven

# Road map
Take the basic functionality from proof of concept to production
* Secure API
* Improve layout/look
* Create a database creation/population library
* Make the app localizable

Create an architecture to allow the platform to be extensible

Deploy app in app stores

Populate product database (so that users doesn't have to)
* Identify major producers of groceries and contact them for access to product data
* Implement database population libraries depending on license from producers

Extend product information with CO2 emissions
* Contact Rise to investigate possibility of access to food climate impact database

AI recognition of symbols regarding packaging material/recycling

AI recognition of product in order to not only give information regarding products lacking packaging

Indicate how large proportion of the product that is made of recycled material

Indicate how easy the product is to recycle

Give information regarding recycling of different products (e.g. that black plastic is harder to recycle)

# Other use cases
It would be simple to extend the product information with for example allergies or similar if there is a community that would be interested
